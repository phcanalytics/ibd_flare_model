## Repository Overview
***

In the public repository, there are two main folders `scripts` and 
`results`. In the program scrips, there is a `data` directory that is 
hidden and not included as we no longer have access to data due to data use agreements with Optum.

- `scripts`: Two sub folders in this folder. 
  - `analysis`: Contains the scripts to fit and test predictive models
  - `sql_query`: Contains SQL queries and scripts to build the analysis
   dataframe to use in analyses. Requires Optum license and data cut of IBD patients.

- `results`: Folder that contains results. See overview in analysis 
  folder for where specific model results are saved.
